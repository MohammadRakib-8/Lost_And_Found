    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our Lost and Found Management System is designed to help students and staff 
      at AIUB report and recover lost or found items efficiently. Users can submit 
      reports for lost or found belongings, and search or claim matched items. The goal is to provide a structured, user-friendly 
      platform to make item recovery easier within the campus :)
